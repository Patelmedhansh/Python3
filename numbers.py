# Number datatype is also a very commonly used datatype in python
# we can do multiple arethmatic operationns using numbers 

# addition
 
print(2+3) 

# for substraction (-) , for multiplication (*), for division (/) 
# we can also manupulate the fllow oftheoperation 
# for example 

print(3 * 4 +5 ) # this will give output of 17 

print(3* (4+5)) # this will give the output of 27 as it will add first and then multiply 

# modulus operation 

print( 10 % 3 ) # it is read as 10 mod (%) 3 , basically it means then first number divided by second number 
# it will give remainder as output 

# you can also store numbers inside a variable 

num = 3
print(num) 

# Apart from basic arethematic we can do some other stuff as well using numbers 

# converting nuber into string 

print(str(num)) # it is helpful when we want to print a number alongside a string 
# example 
print(str(num) + " is a one digit one ") 

# Functions on number 

# abs stands for absolute value of a number 

num2= -3
print(abs(num2)) 

#pow 
print(pow(3 ,2 )) # it will give 3 ^ 2s

# max 
print(max(5,6)) # it will give the maximum number outof the two numbers

# min 
print(min(5,6)) # gives minimum value 

# round 

print(round(3.9)) # it will round the number 

# In Python youcanimport functions in order to do specific math task 
from math import * 

print (floor(3.7)) # it will give the minimum value , chop off the decimal values 

# square root 

print(sqrt(8))  # it will give the square root of the number 

# NOTE :- THERE ARE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS YOU CAN PERFORM WITH NUMBERS, YOU CAN GOGGLE THE  LIST :)
